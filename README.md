<h1> Hands On With Wazuh </h1>
This is the central repo for all my hands-on experience with Wazuh SIEM. Each project should contain goals, documentation, and write-ups.

Enjoy!

<h1> Why Wazuh</h1>

<br>
<a href="https://wazuh.com/">Wazuh</a> is an open-source SIEM and XDR platform with millions of downloads. Online research led me here as a good place to start learning how to protect endpoints (for free!). Many essential security functions and responsibilities are available under the Wazuh toolset.

<br>
<br>
Wazuh has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wazuh/">strong community</a> and well-written <a href="https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/index.html">documentation</a>. I will be using both community-posted solutions and official documentation to support this home lab. I will also try to cite whenever I implement an already solved solution.
