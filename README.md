<h1> Hands On With Wazuh </h1>
Hello! This repo contains write ups, files, scripts, or other useful information as I dig into the Wazuh SIEM.

<h1> Why Wazuh</h1>

<a href="https://wazuh.com/">Wazuh</a> is an open source SIEM and XDR platform with <a href="https://wazuh.com/about-us/#:~:text=A%20world%2Dleading%20cybersecurity%20platform&text=Our%20platform%20has%20more%20than,rely%20on%20our%20solution%20daily.">millions of downloads</a>. Online searching lead me here as a good place
to start learning how to protect endpoints for free. While my endgoal is to get certified in Splunk, and I have work experience managing end devices in MDMs, this will be different as I am setting up the architecture, enrolling devices, and getting into the gnitty gritty of a SIEM. 

<br>

Wazuh has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wazuh/">good community</a> around it and very well written <a href="https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/index.html">documentation</a>. I will be using both community posted solutions and official documentation to support this home-lab. I will try and cite any time I implement an already solved solution.
