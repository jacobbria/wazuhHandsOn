    3 Little Piggies: Snort Set-up
  </h1>
</div>

Snort is an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which I found useful in my <a href="https://github.com/jacobbria/Homelab-SIEM.Hazah-Wazh/tree/main">Wazuh Homelab</a>.
I need a way to detect port scans from Nnamp and send alerts to my endpoints SIEM Manager. So, this side quest had 3 goals - the  3 little piggies

  <h3>üê∑ Detect Nmap port scans</h3>
  <h3>üê∑ Pass logs to Wazuh for detection </h3>

This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwWM0srLSg0&list=PLO0SXQmz3ypmofNFSPnRR7JbJmwvJPSWM&index=2">video</a> by Steve Gantz was followed for this set-up.


One area of difference, if you follow the tutorial video I referenced, is the fact that I'm using the community edition of rules. So, the snort.cof file will need
to be slighly differet. Your $RULE_VAR will need to point to community.rules and all the additional rules included in the default file below $RULE_VAR\community.rules
will need to be wiped. 
Running <i>.\snort -i 5 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -A </i> will test our config files

Our test was successful. Let's ensure it's working with some custom rules

</div>

You can see I simply added these rules - syntax guidlines cound be found <a href="https://docs.snort.org/rules/">here</a> - into the existing community.rules. I
could have, and likely will in the future, have created a local.rules which is the customary place to put local rules. 
No we run <i> .\snort -i 5 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -A console </i> to start Snort up and output any alerts found unto our screen.

</div>

Success! Now <i>.\snort -i 5 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -A fast -l c:\Snort\log</i> ensures ping alerts are logged.

Further pings from Agent B's Kali Linux instance were detected by Snort. We now need to get Snort logs to sent to my Wazub instance.
